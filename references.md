## General Study

* [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) - Great general purpose course building up mathematics and techniques from scratch.
* [Grokking Deep Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) - Upcoming book explaining Deep Learning for the math averse.
* [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - Free book on general data science and statistical modeling.
* [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) - Seminal book on intelligently displaying data with various graphs.  Emphasis on making insight clear and removing distracting "noise ink" from graphs.

## Software

* [Python](python.org) - General purpose interpreted computer language.  Not as fast to compute as compiled languages, but usually faster to write (as a programmer)
* [TensorFlow](tensorflow.org) - Google's machine learning framework.  Very popular these days but still evolving.  May not work well on older hardware.  Has Python bindings.
* [Theano](deeplearning.net/software/theano) - Deep learning framework from University of Montreal.  Similar style to TensorFlow, but works on more hardware and may be easier to compile/install.  Has Python bindings.
* [Keras](keras.io) - High-level deep learning framework that sits on top of TensorFlow or Theano.  My preference for most work. For Python.
* [SciKit-Learn](scikit-learn.org) - General purpose Python library for machine learning with classical techniques.  Great for prototyping and learning but may not be suitable for production code.
* [NumPy](numpy.org) - Numeric computing library for Python.  Full of fast, convenient libraries for operations like arrays, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and more.
* [Matplotlib](matplotlib.org) - Python plotting package for displaying graphs.  Syntax similar to MatLab.  Great for simple line plots, scatter plots, heat maps, and more.
